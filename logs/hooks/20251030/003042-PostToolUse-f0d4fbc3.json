It's not strictly mandatory—the `langgraph.json` configuration simply needs to point to wherever your agent code lives.\n\n## Configuration Essentials\n\nThree key files are required:\n\n1. **langgraph.json** - Points to your agent and environment variables: `\"graphs\": {\"agent\": \"./src/agent.py:agent\"}`\n\n2. **.env file** - Stores the `LANGSMITH_API_KEY` (do not commit to version control)\n\n3. **Agent file** - Contains your compiled LangGraph graph created via `create_agent()`\n\n## Running the Application\n\nThe setup process involves:\n- Installing the LangGraph CLI: `pip install --upgrade \"langgraph-cli[inmem]\"`\n- Installing project dependencies\n- Starting the dev server: `langgraph dev`\n- Accessing Studio at the provided localhost URL\n\nThe guide notes that \"Safari blocks `localhost` connections\" and recommends using the `--tunnel` flag as a workaround.","durationMs":5389,"url":"https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/studio"}}
