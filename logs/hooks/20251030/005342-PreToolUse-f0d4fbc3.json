Conceptual Foundation\n- What is LangGraph and why use it\n- State machines fundamentals (nodes, edges, state)\n- How it differs from your POC scripts (draft-001 to draft-004)\n\n## 2. Visual Architecture\n- State flow diagram showing how PRPState moves through gates\n- Node/edge graph visualization\n- Cost optimization flow diagram\n\n## 3. Code Structure Deep-Dive\n- Walk through `base_prp_workflow.py` architecture\n- Explain each component (workflows, nodes, utils, schemas)\n- Show how pieces connect together\n\n## 4. Extension Patterns\n- How to add custom gates\n- How to override configuration\n- How to extend for your specific projects\n\n## 5. Hands-On Learning Script\n- Create an interactive exploration tool\n- Step through workflow execution with pauses\n- Show state at each step\n\nDeliverables:\n- `LEARNING_GUIDE.md` - Complete conceptual walkthrough\n- `docs/architecture_diagrams.md` - Visual flow diagrams\n- `examples/learning/interactive_walkthrough.py` - Step-by-step runner\n- `docs/POC_COMPARISON.md` - Side-by-side with your draft scripts\n\nThis will give you deep understanding of how LangGraph works and how to use/extend it."}}
